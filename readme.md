## Rock Paper Scissors UI

This is a simple ui game of rock paper scissors for The Odin Project online bootcamp.

It works fully from the browser, using buttons to get input from the user.

It has been designed using JavaScript DOM queries in order to calculate the score of the game and communicate this back to the user.

It is a five round game of rock paper scissors against the computer, whoever comes out with the most points at the end of five rounds wins!
